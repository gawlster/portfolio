# Portfolio

A personal website with my portfolio to be submitted with any job applications.

## What is the project?

This project is a personal website for myself to go along with job applications. It is to introduce myself to potential employers, and to showcase some recent work I have been doing. It is also a good place for me to experiment with new concepts and ideas within html, css, and js, constantly updating and fixing things.

## Lifecycle

### First iteration:

The first iteration of my website was built during my CSC130 class as a required project. The format for the first iteration had some restrictions related to the assignment specification. When users loaded into the page, they were met by the home screen which had a NASA space image as the background. I had some simple html and css to make my name and a short description about myself in the center using a grid. I also had a simple navbar at the top of the screen which could help users navigate to different subpages.

The homescreen of the first iteration of my website:

The project called for subpages for us to practice using anchor tags so clicking on any of the links in the navbar. I created an 'about me' page, a 'projects' page, a 'resume' page (which used a completely different style, as per assignment specifications), and a 'contact' page. As I was just learning HTML and CSS, I made the terrible mistake of placing a grid on the body of each page, rather than containing the contents of the page in its own grid container. This made for some difficulties when organizing the layout of each page, and also some bugs for different screen sized. Overall, the layout was not terrible, but it could've been much better, and could've been done a lot easier.

The about page of the first iteration of my website:

For the deadline of the project, I did not get around to doing the projects page of the website. It was not a required portion of the assignment, so I dedicated my time to other aspects of the page. Regardless, here is the page:

As I mentioned earlier, the resume section needed to use a different stylesheet than the rest of the page, so I came up with this styling:

And finally, perhaps the sub-page I spent the most time working on, the contact form. This contact form was really ugly! But it worked. I spent a lot of time working on making it functional, meaning when someone filled out the form, an email would be sent to me containing their answers to each of the inputs. I accomplished this using <a href="https://formsubmit.co">FormSubmit</a>, which worked fine.

### Second iteration:

The current state of the project is in this second iteration. As I wasn't working with assignment restrictions, I had the freedom to change a few things to my liking. First and foremost, I made the entire page in one html document, and allowed a scrolling behaviour, rather than many subpages. I still included the navbar at the top of the screen, but made it smooth scroll to whichever section the user clicks on. I like this style of webpage a lot better, because it allows the user multiple ways of navigating a page, rather than requiring them to use the navbar. Another notable change was with the homescreen. While I still had my name and position set in the middle, followed by my social media links, but I changed the background to something a little bit lighter (I chose a picture of a beach). In future iterations, I will likely change this image again.

As you can see from the images, the layout was much neater, and at the same time it was much easier to update the layout of certain components without altering the entire page.

### Still to come...

There is still a lot of work to be done with this website. To see a full list of things to-do, check out the `Issues` section of the repo. This README will be updated periodically to reflect changes and updates.
If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, please feel free to add an issue to the repo, and I will take a look at it!
