                    </h1>
                    <p class="from-left fall-in">Hello, my name is Connor Gawley. I am a 19 year old student at the University of Victoria studying Computer Science. I have been fascinated with technology ever since I got my first iPod Touch back in the second grade. I was always curious as to how I was able to use a singular machine to play games, watch movies, and talk to friends, no matter where I was. Shortly after getting my iPod, my parents got me my first gaming console, the Nintendo Gameboy, and to say this sparked a new curiosity is an understatement. I was blown away that a tiny plastic rectangle with a mini TV could allow me to play a game for hours on end. On top of that, just taking out the tiny game card and swapping to a different one gave me an entirely new game.<br><br><br></p>
                    <p class="from-right fall-in">Fast-forward ten years to when I was 17, just gradutating high school, and still just as curious as I was when I was a child. It was at this point that I built my first PC. When I got it all set up, I immediately went to Google to start to learn to code, which was when I discovered SoloLearn, a website for complete beginners to learn the art of programming. I worked through the Python course, while building some (admittedly bad) projects.<br><br><br></p>
                    <p class="from-left fall-in">I started studying at the University of Victoria during the fall of 2020, right in the swing of COVID19. While it wasn't exactly what I expected for my first year of university, I still had a great time learning more about Python and Java while refining my problem-solving skills. During the first semester, I made my first larger Python project, and that was a command line 'Craps' game. While building this project, I accounted for many different types of bets, a chip counter to keep track of the player's total chips (although their total reset every time the program was run), and TONS of output to make the player really feel like part of the game. If I were to go back and make the project again, I would definitely spend some time making a Graphical User Interface, but I still think playing in the command line is very fun.<br><br><br></p>
                    <p class="from-right fall-in">So far in my second year I have been having a lot of fun. I have really enjoyed being in Victoria and being able to explore the campus and the city. Even the ten minute walk between classes is a great way to refresh my mind after a lecture or a lab. I have had the opportunity to use new technologies this year, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and C. These technologies have been so much fun to learn because they really opened my eyes to entirely new methods of programming. For example, HTML and CSS are written completely differently than Python and Java, and they hold the power to precisely change what the user sees when looking at the final version of the project. It was a little bit awkward at first to debug HTML and CSS code, but with the Chrome Developer Tools, this became a lot more manageable. I decided to create a website and resume for myself using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which I could use to introduce myself to potential employers.<br><br><br></p>
                    <p class="from-left fall-in">C, on the other hand, was a completely different beast. Because it is such a low-level language, I got the opportunity to immerse myself in pointers. It was challenging at first to grasp the entire idea of pointers since it is so different than most other programming concepts, but once I got it I came to appreciate the beauty of using memory locations rather than memory data. During my 'Software Engineering Methods (SENG265)' course, we were given the assingment of creating a C program to parse and condense data from an XML file into a more readable output, and then using that data to narrow the output to only show a specific section. Also during this course I got my first opportunity to use Git, which I now feel confident using for all of my projects.<br><br><br></p>
